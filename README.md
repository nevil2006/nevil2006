### About Me

I’m a B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at KGiSL Institute of Technology. My work bridges intelligent systems and impactful design—combining computer vision, machine learning, and edge deployment with frontend development. I focus on applied AI problems, particularly in domains like healthcare, traffic systems, and document intelligence.

### Projects & Applications

#### Smart Traffic Management System
Built a real-time object detection system using YOLOv5 on ESP32-CAM modules to monitor and analyze vehicle movement. This project was approved by the Coimbatore City Police and targeted smart traffic flow regulation using edge computing.

#### Vision-Language Models for Breast Cancer Classification
Applied OpenAI’s CLIP model to classify histopathology images by subtype using prompt-based zero-shot learning. The project focused on explainable AI in medical diagnosis and was conducted as part of a research internship.

#### Research Paper Summarizer with BERT
Assisted a research group by automating the extraction and summarization of ML concepts from academic papers using transformer-based models. Implemented NLP pipelines for topic modeling and information retrieval.
