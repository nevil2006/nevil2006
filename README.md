###  About Me

I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in **Artificial Intelligence & Data Science** at KGiSL Institute of Technology.  
What sets my journey apart is not just academic performanceâ€”but building **deployed AI systems** that solve real-world challenges in **traffic, healthcare, and research automation**.

I focus on:
- **Vision-Language Models** for medical image interpretation  
- **Real-time computer vision systems** on embedded devices  
- **Document intelligence** using BERT & NLP  
- **Bridging backend AI with responsive front-end designs**

###  Selected Projects
## Projects

### PathoVision: AI-Driven Breast Lesion Classification using CLIP and RN50  
**Duration:** June 2025 â€“ July 2025  
**Organization:** Centre for Machine Learning and Intelligence (CMLI)  

PathoVision is an AI-powered framework that uses OpenAIâ€™s CLIP model with ResNet-50 (RN50) to classify breast lesions into benign or malignant categories, including 8 subtypes. The system leverages natural language prompts for classification, enabling zero-shot and few-shot inference.

- Applied prompt engineering techniques to improve classification explainability
- Fine-tuned CLIP for histopathology image interpretation
- Evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix

**Technologies:** CLIP, RN50, PyTorch, Vision-Language Models, Data Augmentation, Prompt Engineering
  

### Eco-Friendly Product Showcase Website  
**Duration:** May 2025 â€“ June 2025  
**Organization:** KGiSL Institute of Technology  

Developed a responsive front-end website to promote eco-friendly products. The site includes a product gallery, contact form, and about section with a clean, green-themed UI to align with environmental sustainability goals.

- Built using semantic HTML and responsive Bootstrap layouts
- Designed for cross-device compatibility and user engagement
- Demonstrates strong front-end fundamentals

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap


### AI-Based Smart Traffic Management System  
**Duration:** September 2024 â€“ May 2025  
**Organization:** KGiSL Institute of Technology  

Designed an AI-based traffic management system using computer vision and IoT to optimize traffic signals and prioritize emergency vehicles. The system utilizes YOLOv11s with ESP32-CAM and radar sensors to detect traffic density and respond in real-time.

- Integrated YOLO-based detection with signal control logic
- Implemented DeepSORT for vehicle tracking
- Approved and tested by the Traffic Department, Coimbatore

**Technologies:** YOLOv11s, Python, OpenCV, ESP32-CAM, DeepSORT, Real-time Data Processing
