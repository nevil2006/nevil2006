## About Me

I am a B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at KGiSL Institute of Technology (2023–2027), focused on building practical and reliable AI systems for real-world applications.

My work spans computer vision, vision-language models, and applied machine learning, with experience in taking systems from concept to deployment. I have worked on real-world solutions that were evaluated and approved for pilot deployment and have also contributed to mentoring and developing academic engineering projects.

I have a strong foundation in problem-solving, data structures, and system-level thinking.
