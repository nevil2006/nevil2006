###  About Me

I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in **Artificial Intelligence & Data Science** at KGiSL Institute of Technology.  
What sets my journey apart is not just academic performanceâ€”but building **deployed AI systems** that solve real-world challenges in **traffic, healthcare, and research automation**.

I focus on:
- **Vision-Language Models** for medical image interpretation  
- **Real-time computer vision systems** on embedded devices  
- **Document intelligence** using BERT & NLP  
- **Bridging backend AI with responsive front-end designs**

###  Selected Projects

#### 1. Smart Traffic Surveillance System (Govt. Approved)
**Tech Stack:** YOLOv5, OpenCV, Python, ESP32-CAM  
**Overview:**  
Designed and deployed a real-time vehicle detection system using embedded hardware (ESP32-CAM) and YOLOv5 for smart city traffic management. The system detects and tracks live traffic flow at intersections and was aimed at congestion control and incident detection.  
**Outcome:**  
Approved by the **Commissioner of Police, Coimbatore** for its potential to enhance city-wide traffic monitoring.  
**Role:**  
Led the entire pipelineâ€”model training, hardware deployment, and testing under real-world conditions.

---

#### 2. Eco-Friendly IoT System  
**Tech Stack:** Arduino, Sensors, Embedded C, Environmental Monitoring Tools  
**Overview:**  
Built a low-power IoT device capable of monitoring air quality and water usage in urban residential settings. Focused on minimizing environmental footprint through sensor-driven automation.  
**Outcome:**  
Demonstrated strong potential for sustainable living as part of an urban eco-innovation challenge.  
**Role:**  
Developed hardware logic, interfaced sensors, and calibrated outputs with energy efficiency in focus.

---

#### 3. Breast Cancer Subtype Classification using CLIP  
**Tech Stack:** CLIP (OpenAI), PyTorch, Prompt Engineering, Vision-Language Models  
**Overview:**  
Explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP to classify breast cancer subtypes from histopathology images using natural language prompts and zero-shot learning techniques.  
**Outcome:**  
Achieved explainable classification behavior with improved interpretability for medical practitioners. Conducted as part of a research internship under the Centre for Machine Learning & Intelligence (CMLI).  
**Role:**  
Performed prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and evaluation using metrics like F1-score and confusion matrix.
